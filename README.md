# MyBB-SteamActivation-CLWO-Appeal-plugin

This plugin, made for the clwo.eu community forums, takes care of people that want to appeal their blacklist.
IT keeps track of previous appeals, gives the admins easy accept/deny links, appends information about the blacklisted user to his posts, keeps track of which post is still running and which are finished, et cetera.
